This is the Python application that I managed to create in the week period that was allocated.

The webpage is simplistic in design, but most of the functionality does work.

The webpage does not allow navigation to the other pages without first logging in, or signing up.

In order to begin using the application use the following steps:
- Open up command prompt and navigate to the folder destination of the application
- Once there run the command 'python manage.py runserver'
- Open up any internet browser and go to the url '127.0.0.1:8000/login'
- From there you can log in using authorized user credentials, and if you have none, you can use the sign up page to create credentials. Once you have signed up correctly, you will automatically be logged in.

In order to create, edit or delete clients or projects, you will need to use admin credentials to login at '127.0.0.1:8000/admin' (the credentials are: username - peter, password - kollege13)
